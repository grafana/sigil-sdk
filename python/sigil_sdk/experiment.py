"""Generic experiment runner for Sigil offline evaluation.

This module rides on top of the core SDK's generation recording so that
generations emitted while an agent runs are automatically tagged with an
experiment ``run_id`` — no framework adapter required. It is the framework-free
counterpart to ``sigil-sdk-langgraph``'s experiment runner: where the LangGraph
version wires the run into ``graph.invoke(config=run.langgraph_config())``, this
version wires it into ``with run.start_generation(...) as rec:`` (a thin wrapper
over :meth:`Client.start_generation`).

It provides:

- :func:`experiment` — a context manager that creates the run, and finalizes it
  on exit (``succeeded`` normally, ``failed`` on error or Ctrl-C).
- :class:`ExperimentRunner` — a thin loop over a dataset that invokes a user
  target and one or more user scorers, exporting scores per item.

The flow is generation-first and publishes continuously by default: create the
run, then for each item run the agent (exporting generations through
:meth:`ExperimentRun.start_generation`), grade locally, and export scores
attributed to the same ``run_id``. Grading is entirely user-supplied: a scorer
is any callable returning :class:`ScoreOutput` records.
